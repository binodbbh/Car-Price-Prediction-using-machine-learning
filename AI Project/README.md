# Car Price Prediction Project

This repository is a **college assignment project** focused on predicting car prices using machine learning techniques. The project includes data, a Jupyter notebook for model development, and the best trained model.

## Project Structure

- `car_price_prediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `best_model.pkl`: Serialized (pickled) best-performing machine learning model for car price prediction.
- `cars-data/`: Directory containing datasets and prediction outputs.
    - `cars_data.csv`: Raw car dataset.
    - `cleaned_cars_data.csv`: Cleaned version of the dataset used for modeling.
    - `random_predictions.json`: Example predictions generated by the model.
- `cars-data.zip`: Compressed archive of the dataset.

## Machine Learning Models Used

Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated for car price prediction:

- **Random Forest Regressor**: Robust to outliers and provides feature importance, but prone to overfitting in this context.
- **LightGBM Regressor**: Fast, efficient, and handles large datasets and categorical features well. After hyperparameter tuning, this model achieved the best performance and is saved as `best_model.pkl`.
- **Linear Regression**: Used as a baseline for comparison and interpretability, but underfits the data due to its simplicity.

The final deployed model is a **tuned LightGBM Regressor**, selected for its superior generalization and predictive accuracy.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory.
2. **Install dependencies** (see below).
3. **Open** `car_price_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to explore the data and model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- (Optional) matplotlib, seaborn for visualization

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

- Run the notebook to see the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- Use `best_model.pkl` to make predictions on new data (see notebook for example code).

## Data

The dataset contains various features about cars, such as make, model, year, mileage, and price. The data is cleaned and preprocessed before training the model.
